The users have the opportunity to create a collective family space, where they can use money together. The invitation by family owners to the group can be through email.

## Technologies Used

### Backend (API)

-   PHP 8.2 & Laravel 11
-   PostgreSQL
-   Laravel Sanctum (for API Authentication)

### Frontend (Client)

-   React 18 & Vite
-   Tailwind CSS
-   React Router
-   Chart.js   

## Deployment

The deployment of the application is based on a modern decoupled architecture that is scalable and has performance guarantees.

### Backend (Laravel API)

- **Service:** Hosted on **Render**.
- **Process:** The API is containerized with the assistance of the Docker and is executed as a web service. Render is a tool that automatically constructs the Docker image based on the Dockerfile and deploy it, attaching it to an instance of a managed PostgreSQL database.

### Frontend (React App)

- **Service:** Linked to **Cloudflare Pages**.
- **Workflow:** Cloudflare Pages has direct connection with the GitHub repository. With each push to the main branch, it will construct the React application (with the npm run build command) then deploy the static files to its global edge network.
